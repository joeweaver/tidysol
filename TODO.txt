don't clobber existing files - notably csv sources
tidy should handle t, x, y, z etc passed in from vars output
non-transient solutions
quicker run time for getting metadata/vars
handle case where a column is given with whitespace around it (example, add a line after line 28 in tidy.py col=col.strip())
    need to add test case, maybe better spot for the logic
